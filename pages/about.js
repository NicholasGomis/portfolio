            <p className={styles.textpara} > Once I earned my diploma, I decided to continue my academic studies in the United Kingdom, due to its opportunities and the diversities which had always intrigued me. During my time in the UK, I gained my Bachelor in Computer Hardware and Software Engineer at Coventry University and a MSc in Manufacturing Engineering with Management at University of Warwick.</p>
